### Pratice

The line graph compares four types of electric power source in France from 1980 to 2012.

The graph shows that the Nuclear power was the most importpart part of electricity generation, while Renewables power produce lowest in every year.

In 1980, the Thermal power genrated is the main resource of electricity production with 125 terawatt per hour,  the Nuclear power and Hydroelectric power both provided nearly 70 terawatt per hour, while the Renewables power provided almost 0. Just one year later, the Nuclear power became the primary resource of electricity.

Duiring these 32 years, the Nuclear power rose rapidly, with heighest to almost 425 terawatt hours per hour. Thermal power dropped from 125 to 50 terawatt per hour and the Hydroelectric power reamain stable on 50 - 60 terawatt per hour. As a contrast, the Renewables power only had a small rise to 25 hour by 2012.

## Bar chart

### Practice

The bar chart compares the amount of phone sold by the five most popular brand in 2009, 2011 and 2013.

It is clear that Nokia sold the most in 2009 and 2011, while in 2013 Samsung became the seller. LG sold less and less by each year and ZTE remained its sellings nealy 50 millions.

In 2009 ,Nokia sold cloase to 450 millions phone, which was almost the double of Samsungs sales. In 2011, Samsung phone sales rose from 240 to 330 millions which is the second biggest phone brand. In 2013, Samsung sales came to 450 millions  which made it became the primary phone brand. As a contrast, Nokia only sold 220 millions their phone, which was just a half of their sales by 2009.

From 2009 to 2019, Apple sales also rose rapidly each year, from 40 millions to 140 millions. LG sold 110 millions in 2009 and decreased nearly 30 millions each year. And ZTE sold 55 millions in 2019 and it ramained it stably till 2013.
