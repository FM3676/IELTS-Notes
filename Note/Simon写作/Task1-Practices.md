### Pratice

The line graph compares four types of electric power source in France from 1980 to 2012.

The graph shows that the Nuclear power was the most importpart part of electricity generation, while Renewables power produce lowest in every year.

In 1980, the Thermal power genrated is the main resource of electricity production with 125 terawatt per hour,  the Nuclear power and Hydroelectric power both provided nearly 70 terawatt per hour, while the Renewables power provided almost 0. Just one year later, the Nuclear power became the primary resource of electricity.

Duiring these 32 years, the Nuclear power rose rapidly, with heighest to almost 425 terawatt hours per hour. Thermal power dropped from 125 to 50 terawatt per hour and the Hydroelectric power reamain stable on 50 - 60 terawatt per hour. As a contrast, the Renewables power only had a small rise to 25 hour by 2012.

## Bar chart

![Bar-Chart](Task1-Images/Task1-Pratices/Bar-Chart.png)

### Practice

The bar chart compares the amount of phone sold by the five most popular brand in 2009, 2011 and 2013.

It is clear that Nokia sold the most in 2009 and 2011, while in 2013 Samsung became the seller. LG sold less and less by each year and ZTE remained its sellings nealy 50 millions.

In 2009 ,Nokia sold cloase to 450 millions phone, which was almost the double of Samsungs sales. In 2011, Samsung phone sales rose from 240 to 330 millions which is the second biggest phone brand. In 2013, Samsung sales came to 450 millions  which made it became the primary phone brand. As a contrast, Nokia only sold 220 millions their phone, which was just a half of their sales by 2009.

From 2009 to 2019, Apple sales also rose rapidly each year, from 40 millions to 140 millions. LG sold 110 millions in 2009 and decreased nearly 30 millions each year. And ZTE sold 55 millions in 2019 and it ramained it stably till 2013.

## Pie Chart

![Pie-Chart](Task1-Images/Task1-Pratices/Pie-Chart.png)

### Practice

The pie chart compares five categories of hosehold spenmding in UK and New Zealand from 1980 to 2008.

It is clear that the proportion of spending on foods decreased in both conturies espically in UK. Also, the UK residents spent more on their utility bills.

In 1980, the foods and drinks took 23% of household spending in UK and 29% in New Zealand. In 2008, these figures became 13% and 25%, both were decreased. As a contrast, The spending on utility bills were increased in both conturies, from 26 % to 28% in UK and 27% to 31% in New Zealand.

Leisure activities accounted for most in UK household spending in both years, while the counterpart in New Zealand just fallen by 1% to 17%. The transport spedning fallen by 1% in both countries during the period. The other spending are both took 9% in 1980 and 11% in 2008.

#### Tips

- Don’t describe each country separatly
- Don’t describe each year separately
- Compare countries and years <u>together</u>
- Mention all 5 categories (food & drink etc.)
- Divide the catergories into two groups for the two ‘details’ paragraphs
- The category called ‘Other’ is not important
- Don’t write ‘Leisure was 34%’
- Write “Households spend 34% of their money on leisure”

### 2 Different charts

![2-Different-Chart](Task1-Images/Task1-Pratices/2-Different-Chart.png)

The bar chart compares the numbers of male and female joining 4 types of classes in 2009. The pie chart shows the age of these attenders.

It is noticable that most of women prefered attend the Language class while men would like to joined in the Painting course. Meanwhile, almost half of students were 50 or over.

The bar chart shows that drama, panting and language attracted more women that men to join the class. In spint of Sculpture had male student than female, it's stundents number was miniumn. As a contrast, language course were the most popular one, attracted 40 female students and 20 male students. The another class that the number of male studens was half of female students was drama, with 10 male students and 20 female students.

From the pie chart we can know that 68% of students' age were over 40, with 42% over 50 and 26% between 40 and 49. Meanwhile, both age between 20 and 29 and aged under 29 were 16%, with 5% under 20 and 11% aged from 20 to 29.
