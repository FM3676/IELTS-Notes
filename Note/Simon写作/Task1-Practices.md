## Line Graph

![Line-Graph](Task1-Images/Task1-Pratices/Line-Graph.png)

The line graph compares four types of electric power source in France from 1980 to 2012.

The graph shows that the Nuclear power was the most importpart part of electricity generation, while Renewables power produce lowest in every year.

In 1980, the Thermal power genrated is the main resource of electricity production with 125 terawatt per hour,  the Nuclear power and Hydroelectric power both provided nearly 70 terawatt per hour, while the Renewables power provided almost 0. Just one year later, the Nuclear power became the primary resource of electricity.

Duiring these 32 years, the Nuclear power rose rapidly, with heighest to almost 425 terawatt hours per hour. Thermal power dropped from 125 to 50 terawatt per hour and the Hydroelectric power reamain stable on 50 - 60 terawatt per hour. As a contrast, the Renewables power only had a small rise to 25 hour by 2012.
