## Lesson 2 - Introductions

### Method:

- **2 sentences**
  - Introuduce the topic
  - Give a general answer

### Four types of questions

1. Discussion
2. Opinion
3. Problem and solution
4. Two-part question

#### 1. Discussion

> Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discuss both views and give your own opinion

##### Plan

- Topic - study in groups or alone
- Answer - sometimes better alone, usually better in a group

People <u>have different views about</u> effectiveness of froup study as <u>opposed to</u> working <u>alone.While</u> there are some benefits to studying independently, I <u>believe that</u> group work is usually more productive.

#### 2. Opinion

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

##### Plan

- Topic - community service for all teenagers
- Answer - 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible)

<u>It is sometimes argued</u> that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities.

- Agree: I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea
- Disagree: In my opinion, it would be wrong to <u>force</u> teenagers to do ant kind of <u>unsalaried</u> work.
- Balanced opinion: While I <u>disagree</u> with the idea of making such programmes <u>compulsory</u>, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit yound people.

#### 3. Problem and solution

> Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?

##### Plan

- Topic - cirminals reoffend
- Answer - serveral reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities) (NO exact solutions here, they should.be at main paragraphs. Here we just cover the problemns and the solutions)

<u>It is true that</u> punishments do not always <u>deter</u> criminals <u>from</u> committing more crimes. There are various reasons why offenders <u>repeatedly break the law</u>, but governments could certainly <u>take steps to address</u> this issue.

> Here we don't give the reason yet, and do't give the solutions or the steps. Just mention that their serveral measures and governments could take steps.

#### 4. Two-part question

> As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?

##### Plan

- Topic - job satisfaction
- Answer - several factors, unrealistic / impossible

Work <u>plays a central role in our lives</u>, and we would all like to <u>feel fulfilled professionally</u>. <u>While</u> a variety of factors may <u>lead to</u> job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.

## Lesson 3 - Main body paragraphs

### 4 paragraph essay

- 2 main body paragraphs
- 5 sentences in each
- 90 to 100 words each

### How to write a main paragraph

#### 2 types of main body paragraph

1. Firstly, Secondly, Finally
   - Use when we have more that one idea
   - Perfect for advantages, disadvantages, problems, solutions 
2. Idea, Explain, Example
   - When we have only one idea and need to explain it in detail
   - Perfect for on idea, a reason, an opinion

#### 1. Firstly, Secondly, Finally

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

##### 3-minute plan:

- disagree for several reasons
- school timetable is full, no time for community service
- students' work in other subjects would be affected
- teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation )

There are several reasons why I would argue against having <u>compulsory community service</u> for secondary school students. <u>**Firstly**</u>, the school <u>curriculum</u> is already full with important <u>academic subjects</u>, <u>such as</u> maths, science and languages. <u>**For example**</u>, I remember having an <u>extremely busy timetable</u> when I was at high school, and it would <u>not have been</u> possible to add to it. <u>**Secondly**</u>, <u>students' performance</u> in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were take by <u>charity work of neightbourhood improvement schemes</u>. <u>**Finally**</u>, I believe that teenage students would be <u>reluctant</u> to take party in any programme of <u>obligatory</u> work, and this could lead to <u>poor motivation</u> and even bad behaviour

##### Try to write 5 sentences

1. Topic sentence
2. Firstly <u>(5. explain more, or add example)</u>
3. Secondly
4. Finally 

##### Remeber:

Linking words do <u>not</u> help your 'vocabulary' score

Examiners want to see 'topic vocabulary'

> **Topic vocabulary:**
>
> - compulsory community service
> - school curriculum
> - academic subjects
> - extremely busy timetable
> - students' performance
> - charity work of neightbourhood improvement schemes
> - reluctant
> - obligatory
> - poor motivation

##### Notes:

- Linking words do not help you to get a higher vocabulary score, but they do help your ‘coherence and cohesion’ score (organisation).

- You won’t improve your score by using ‘difficult’ linking words. It **isn’t** more difficult to use “first and foremost” instead of “firstly”.

- If both main paragraphs contain three ideas, try not to use “firstly, secondly, finally” twice. In the first paragraph above, we could change “Firstly” to “One reason is that...” and we could change “Secondly” to “Furthermore”.

#### 2. Idea, Explain, Example

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

##### 3-minute plan:

Although we disagree with this compulsory idea, we dook think that a voluntary community service program could be good for students

- voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive 
- students more motivated if they can choose
- gain work experience, self confidence, skills
- good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers

> After finish the plan, look at the ideas and think it this 3 sperate points or just one point explained in detail

<u>**On the other hand**</u>, the opportunity to do voluntary community service sould be extremely positve for high school students. <u>**By making these progrsmmrd optional**</u>, schools would ensure that only motivated students took part. <u>**These young people would gain**</u> valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. <u>**Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve**</u> school <u>leavers</u>' career <u>prospects</u>. <u>**For example**</u>, a period of voluntary work experience might <u>impress a university admissions officer or a future employer</u>.

> 每一个句子每个点都是对上一个观点更进一步的解释，为什么。例如，我们先说了 **voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive**， 为什么 positive呢？ 因为**students more motivated if they can choose**。那么他们参加了，又有什么好处呢？**gain work experience, self confidence**, skills。在获得这些以后，带来什么效益呢？**good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers**。最后，举一个简单的**example**即可。

##### Try to write 5 sentences

1. Idea
2. Explain (2 or 3 sentences)
3. Example (could change the position, e.g. put it after the Idea)

##### Remeber:

Linking words do <u>not</u> help your 'vocabulary' score

Examiners want to see 'topic vocabulary'

> **Topic vocabulary:**
>
> - opportunity
> - voluntary community service
> - programmes optional
> - ensure that only motivated students took part
> - gain valuable experience
> - adult working enviorment
> - build their self confidence
> - enhance their skills
> - school leavers' career prospects
> - impress a university admissions officer or a future employer

## Lesson 4 - Conclusions

### 2 easy 'rules'

- never write anything new -- just conclude or summarize what you've already said, if you are asked to give opinion, don't give it in the conclusion, but should be clear throughtout the whole essay what it is.
- one sentence: repeat, summarize

### Conclusion technique

Paraphrase the answer that you gave in your introduction

### Four types of questions

1. Discussion (+ opinion)
2. Opinion
3. Problem and solution
4. Two-part question

#### 1. Discussion (+ opinion)

> In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom. Do the benfits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?

##### Introduction

It is true that video <u>surveillance</u> has become <u>commonplace</u> in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, <u>I believe</u> that there are more benefits than drawbacks.

##### Conclusion

<u>**In conclusiuon**</u>, <u>I would argue</u> that the advantages of using <u>video security systems</u> in public places do <u>outweigh the disadvantages</u>.

> Start with 'In conclusion'
>
> I believe ---- I would ar⁄gue
>
> Video surveillance ---- video security systems
>
> Outweigh the disadvantages ---- more benefits that drawbacks

#### 2. Opinion

> Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

##### Introduction

<u>Some people believe that</u> parents of children who attend private schools should not need to <u>contribute</u> to state schools through taxes. <u>Personally</u>, I <u>completely</u> disagree with this view.

##### Conclusion

<u>**In conclusion**</u>, <u>I do not believe</u> that any <u>financial concessions</u> should be made for people who choose private education.

> Start with 'In conclusion'
>
> I do not believe ---- I completely disagree
>
> financial concessions ---- should not need to contribute to taxes
>
> people who choose private education ---- parents of children who attend private schools

#### 3. Problem and solution

> In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.

##### Introduction

It is true that people in <u>industrialized nations</u> can expect to longer that ever before. Although there will <u>undoubtedly</u> be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to <u>mitigate</u> these potential problems.

##### Conclusion

<u>**In conclusion**</u>, various measures can be taken to <u>tackle</u> the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.

> Start with 'In conclusion'
>
> various measures can be taken to tackle ---- societies can take steps to mitigate 
>
> problems that are certain to arise ----there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences
>
> populations of countries grow older ---- people in industrialized nations can expect to longer

#### 4. Two-part question

> There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important that the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?

##### Introduction

<u>It is true that</u> a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is <u>a vital part of all human</u> cultures for <u>a range of</u> reasons, and <u>I would argue</u> that traditional music is <u>more important than</u> modern, international music.

##### Conclusion

<u>**In conclusion**</u>, music is <u>a necessary part of human existence</u>, and <u>I believe</u> that traditional music <u>should be given more importance</u> than international music

> Start with 'In conclusion'
>
> a necessary paet of human existence ---- a viral part of all human cultures 
>
> I believe ---- I would argue
>
> should be given more importance ---- more important 

### Conclusion sentences Notes

- One sentence
- No new information
- Paraphrasing to show variety

> The <u>money spent by goverments</u> on <u>space programmes</u> would be better spent on <u>vital public services</u> such as schools and hospitals. To what extent do <u>**you**</u> <u>**agree or disagree**</u>?

### Planning

2. cheaper e.g. doctors, teachers police instead of astronauts
3. public services impact on everyone
4. we all use schools, hospitals, police, roads etc.
5.  reduce poverty, better quality of life

### Introduction 

#### Plan

- Topic: government spending
- Answer: agree -- public services instead of space projects

Goverments in some countries <u>spend large amounts of money</u> on <u>space exploration programmes</u>. I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should <u>be allocated to</u> public services.

### Paragraph 2

#### Why space spending should be stopped

There are several reasons why space programmes should <u>be abandoned</u>.

#### Expensive (scientists, facilities, equipment)

<u>**Firstly**</u>, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff <u>involved with</u> space missions, and <u>facilities and equipment</u> also <u>come at a huge cost to</u> the goverment.

#### No benfit to normal people, politicans showing power

<u>**Secondly**</u>, these programmes do not benfit normal people in our daily lives, they are simply <u>vanity</u> projects for politicians.

#### Waste of money when projects fail, risk of accidents, deaths

<u>**Finally**</u>, many missions to space fail completely, and the <u>smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives</u>.

#### Example: Challenger space shuttle

The challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.

### Paragraph 3

####  Why public service spending is better

<u>I believe that</u> the money from space programmes should go to <u>vital</u> public services instead

#### Cheaper e.g. doctors, teachers police instead of astronauts

<u>It is much cheaper to train</u> doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on <u>space exploration projects</u>.

####  Public services impact on everyone

<u>Futhermore</u>, public <u>servants</u> do jobs that have a positive impact on <u>every member of</u> society.

#### We all use schools, hospitals, police, roads etc.

<u>For example</u>, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide.

#### Reduce poverty, better quality of life

If governments <u>reallocated the money</u> spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be <u>lifted out of poverty</u> or given a better quality of life.

### Conclusion

#### Spend on services that benfits us all

**<u>In conclusion</u>**, <u>my view is that</u> governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to <u>waste resouces</u> on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.

## Lesson 7 - Full Discusion Essay

> Some people think that a sense of <u>competition</u> in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to <u>co-operate</u> rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss <u>both</u> these <u>views</u> and <u>give your own opinion</u>.

### Planning

#### 1. Read and understand the question

- Highlight / underline key parts

#### 2. Plan your essay structure (4 paragraphs)

1. Introduction: topic + answer
   - Topic: competition or co-operation
   - Answer: benfits of both, co-operation more important
2. Why encourage competition
3. Why teach co-operation (my view)
4. Conclusion: repeat answer 
   - accept both views, co-operation better

#### 3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs (6 minutes)

##### Why encourage competition

motivation to work harder, be better than other children, self confidence, independent work, faster progress, competitive situations when leave school e.g. job interviews, prepared for adult life

###### Number them

1. motivation to work harder
2. be better than other children
3. self confidence
4. competitive situations when leave school e.g. job interviews
5. prepared for adult life

> These are not separate ideas, they are all related.

##### Why teach co-operation (my view)

Co-opearation even more important, e.g. at work (teams, follow boss's instructions, help junior staff), collaboration more useful that winning, better attitude for young people, working together

###### Number them

1. Co-opearation even more important
2. e.g. at work (teams, follow boss's instructions, help junior staff)
3. collaboration more useful that winning
4. better attitude for young people
5. working together

### Introduction 

#### Plan

- Topic: competition or. co-operation
- Answer: benefits of both, co-operation more important

<u>People have differenty views about</u> whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative. <u>While</u> <u>a spirit of</u> competition can sometimes be useful in life, <u>I believe</u> that <u>the ability to</u> co-operate is more important.

### Paragraph 2

#### Why encourage competition? - motivation

<u>**On the one hand**</u>, competition can be a great source of motivation for children.

#### Work harder, be better than other children

When teachers use games or prizes <u>to introduce an element of</u> <u>competitiveness</u> into lessons, it can encourage children to <u>work harder to outdo</u> the other pupils in the class.

#### Self confidence, independent. work, faster progress

This kind of <u>healthy rivalry</u> may help to build children's self confidence, while pushing them to work <u>independently</u> and <u>progress more quickly</u>.

#### Competitive situations when leave school e.g. job interviews

When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in <u>competitive situations</u> <u>such as</u> job interviews.

#### Prepared for adult life

It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

### Paragraph 3

#### Co-operation is more important

<u>**On the other hand**</u>, it is perhaps even more important to prepare children <u>for the many aspects of adult life</u> that <u>require</u> co-operation.

#### e.g. at work (teams, follow boss's instructions, help junior staff)

In the work place, adults are expected to work in teams, <u>follow instructions</u> given by their <u>superiors</u>, or <u>supervise</u> and support the more junior members of staff.

#### Collaboration more useful that winning

Team <u>collaboration</u> skills are much more <u>useful</u> than a <u>competitive determination</u> to win.

#### Better attitude for young people

This is the attitude that <u>I believe</u> schools should <u>foster</u> in yound people.

#### Working together

Instead of <u>promoting the idea</u> that people <u>are either winners or losers</u>, teachers could show children that they can <u>gain more from</u> working together.

### Conclusion

#### Accept both views, co-operation better

<u>**In conclusion**</u>, I can understand why people might want to <u>encourage competitiveness</u> in children, but it seems to me that <u>a co-operative attitude</u> is much more <u>desirable</u> in adult life.
