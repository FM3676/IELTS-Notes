## Lesson 2 - Introductions

### Method:

- **2 sentences**
  - Introuduce the topic
  - Give a general answer

### Four types of questions

1. Discussion
2. Opinion
3. Problem and solution
4. Two-part question

#### 1. Discussion

> Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discuss both views and give your own opinion

##### Plan

- Topic - study in groups or alone
- Answer - sometimes better alone, usually better in a group

People <u>have different views about</u> effectiveness of froup study as <u>opposed to</u> working <u>alone.While</u> there are some benefits to studying independently, I <u>believe that</u> group work is usually more productive.

#### 2. Opinion

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

##### Plan

- Topic - community service for all teenagers
- Answer - 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible)

<u>It is sometimes argued</u> that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities.

- Agree: I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea
- Disagree: In my opinion, it would be wrong to <u>force</u> teenagers to do ant kind of <u>unsalaried</u> work.
- Balanced opinion: While I <u>disagree</u> with the idea of making such programmes <u>compulsory</u>, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit yound people.

#### 3. Problem and solution

> Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?

##### Plan

- Topic - cirminals reoffend
- Answer - serveral reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities) (NO exact solutions here, they should.be at main paragraphs. Here we just cover the problemns and the solutions)

<u>It is true that</u> punishments do not always <u>deter</u> criminals <u>from</u> committing more crimes. There are various reasons why offenders <u>repeatedly break the law</u>, but governments could certainly <u>take steps to address</u> this issue.

> Here we don't give the reason yet, and do't give the solutions or the steps. Just mention that their serveral measures and governments could take steps.

#### 4. Two-part question

> As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?

##### Plan

- Topic - job satisfaction
- Answer - several factors, unrealistic / impossible

Work <u>plays a central role in our lives</u>, and we would all like to <u>feel fulfilled professionally</u>. <u>While</u> a variety of factors may <u>lead to</u> job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.
