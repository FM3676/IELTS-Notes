#### Question 1

> **A useful plant**
>
> Mosses are small flowerless plants that usually grow in dense green clumps, in damp and shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple, one-cell thick leaves, covering a thin stem that supports them. At certain times they produce thin stalks topped with capsules containing spores. They are typically 1-10 centimetres tall, though some species are much larger, like Dawsonia, the tallest moss in the world, which can grow to 50 cm in height.

> **Fill the gap with one word**
>
> 1. Mosses are normally found in  _____________ moisture and shelter from sunlight.

##### Underline 'keywords'

<u>Mosses</u> are <u>normally found in</u>  _____________ <u>moisture</u> and <u>shelter from sunlight</u>.

##### Find the 'keywords' in passage

<u>Mosses</u> are small flowerless plants that <u>usually grow in</u> dense green clumps, in <u>damp</u> and <u>shady</u> locations.

##### Find the answer

这里跟在**in**后面的有clumps，也有locations。答案应该为location，因为前面有修饰**<u>damp</u> and <u>shady</u>**，对应

**<u>moisture</u> and <u>shelter from sunlight</u>**。

## Lesson 3 - True, False, Not given / Yes, No, Not given

### Is there a difference between following?

- True, Flase, Not given
  - When the passage is about <u>facts</u> (Are the statemens true ccording to the information in the passage?)
- Yes, No, Not given
  - When the passsage is about the writer's <u>views</u> (DO the statements agree with the views expressed by the wirter?)

#### Tips:

These differences are not important! We can apporach both questions types in the same way. Just think: correct, incorrect, not given

### Examples

#### True

> While the same <u>meaning could be conveyed</u> through the roughly equivalent *<u>powerful tea,</u>* the fact is that <u>English prefers</u> to speak of tea in terms of being <u>strong rather than</u> in terms of being <u>powerful</u>.

##### Question

It is <u>possible</u>, but <u>not normal</u>, to <u>say 'powerful tea'</u>.

#### Yes - opinion / view

> The <u>information age</u> now <u>buries **us** in data</u> coming at us from every which way

##### Question

The <u>information age</u> is characterised by <u>**our**</u> exposure to an <u>abundance of data</u>.

#### False

> <u>At noon</u> he <u>ceased work for the day</u> and spent hale an hour practicing the flute, on which he became quite a skilled performer.

##### Question

He <u>dedicated</u> the <u>whole day</u> to his <u>work</u>.

#### No

> <u>Most of the choices</u> we make <u>each day</u> may feel like the products of <u>well-considered decision making</u>, <u>**but they're not. They're habits**</u>.

##### Question

The <u>majority of choices</u> we make on a <u>daily</u> basis are <u>conscious decision</u>s.

#### Not given

> He first attracted attenton as "Harry Handcuff <u>Houdini</u>" on a tour of <u>Europe</u>, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up.

##### Question

<u>Houdini</u> was <u>more sucessful</u> in <u>Europe</u> <u>than</u> in <u>America</u>

### Remember 

- True / Yes --- The correct information is given, and you can definitely show that
- False / No --- Different information is given, contradicting the statement
- Not given --- We don't know the answer, there isn't enough or no information
- FInd the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully
- **Answer are always in the correct order in the passage**
