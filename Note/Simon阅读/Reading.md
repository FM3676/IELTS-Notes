### Gap - fill

You can normally find the answers **IN ORDER** in the passage

#### Types of 'gap-fill' question

1. Fill the gaps with words from the passage
2. Fill the gaps to label a diagram
3. Fill the gaps with words from a list / box
4. Fill the gaps in a table

#### Question 1

> **A useful plant**
>
> Mosses are small flowerless plants that usually grow in dense green clumps, in damp and shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple, one-cell thick leaves, covering a thin stem that supports them. At certain times they produce thin stalks topped with capsules containing spores. They are typically 1-10 centimetres tall, though some species are much larger, like Dawsonia, the tallest moss in the world, which can grow to 50 cm in height.

> **Fill the gap with one word**
>
> 1. Mosses are normally found in **\*\***\_**\*\*** moisture and shelter from sunlight.

##### Underline 'keywords'

<u>Mosses</u> are <u>normally found in</u> **\*\***\_**\*\*** <u>moisture</u> and <u>shelter from sunlight</u>.

##### Find the 'keywords' in passage

<u>Mosses</u> are small flowerless plants that <u>usually grow in</u> dense green clumps, in <u>damp</u> and <u>shady</u> locations.

##### Find the answer

这里跟在**in**后面的有 clumps，也有 locations。答案应该为 location，因为前面有修饰**<u>damp</u> and <u>shady</u>**，对应

**<u>moisture</u> and <u>shelter from sunlight</u>**。

## Lesson 3 - True, False, Not given / Yes, No, Not given

### Is there a difference between following?

- True, Flase, Not given
  - When the passage is about <u>facts</u> (Are the statemens true ccording to the information in the passage?)
- Yes, No, Not given
  - When the passsage is about the writer's <u>views</u> (DO the statements agree with the views expressed by the wirter?)

#### Tips:

These differences are not important! We can apporach both questions types in the same way. Just think: correct, incorrect, not given

### Examples

#### True

> While the same <u>meaning could be conveyed</u> through the roughly equivalent _<u>powerful tea,</u>_ the fact is that <u>English prefers</u> to speak of tea in terms of being <u>strong rather than</u> in terms of being <u>powerful</u>.

##### Question

It is <u>possible</u>, but <u>not normal</u>, to <u>say 'powerful tea'</u>.

#### Yes - opinion / view

> The <u>information age</u> now <u>buries **us** in data</u> coming at us from every which way

##### Question

The <u>information age</u> is characterised by <u>**our**</u> exposure to an <u>abundance of data</u>.

#### False

> <u>At noon</u> he <u>ceased work for the day</u> and spent hale an hour practicing the flute, on which he became quite a skilled performer.

##### Question

He <u>dedicated</u> the <u>whole day</u> to his <u>work</u>.

#### No

> <u>Most of the choices</u> we make <u>each day</u> may feel like the products of <u>well-considered decision making</u>, <u>**but they're not. They're habits**</u>.

##### Question

The <u>majority of choices</u> we make on a <u>daily</u> basis are <u>conscious decision</u>s.

#### Not given

> He first attracted attenton as "Harry Handcuff <u>Houdini</u>" on a tour of <u>Europe</u>, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up.

##### Question

<u>Houdini</u> was <u>more sucessful</u> in <u>Europe</u> <u>than</u> in <u>America</u>

### Remember

- True / Yes --- The correct information is given, and you can definitely show that
- False / No --- Different information is given, contradicting the statement
- Not given --- We don't know the answer, there isn't enough or no information
- FInd the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully
- **Answer are always in the correct order in the passage**

## Lesson 4 - Matching paragraph headings

Choose the best heading form a list of headings for each paragraph in the passage.

### 'Pargraph headings' questions are difficult

Because the answers are <u>not in order</u> in the passage and because some of the headings may be similar.

### Techniques

1. Do 'paragraph headings' questions last
   - Do all other questions for that passage first
   - You will then be more familar with the passage
   - You might get some of the answers from memory
2. Underline 'keywords' in each heading on the list
3. Then read the shortest or easiest paragraph
   - Read at normal speed
   - Underline the main ideas in the paragraph
   - Compare with <u>all</u> of the headings
   - Choose the best one

## Lesson 5 - Which paragraph contains?

Find which paragraph contains the information in each statement from a list.

### 'Which paragraph contains' questions are difficult

- The answer are <u>not in order</u> in the passage
- The same paragraph may contain more than one answer
- Some of the paragraphs may not contain any answers

### Techniques

1. Do 'which paragraph contains' questions last
   - Do all other questions for that passage first
   - You will then be more familar with the passage
   - You might get some of the answers from memory
2. Underline 'keywords' in each heading on the list
3. Then read the shortest or easiest paragraph
   - Information that you remember reading about
   - Easy keywords that you can <u>scan</u> for

## Lesson 6 - Multiple choice questions

Multiple choice questions can be difficult because there is a lot to read, and the choice can be similar and confusing. You can normally find the answers <u>in order</u> in the passage.

## Lesson 7 - Matching names

- A list of question <u>statements</u>
- A box containing a list of <u>names</u>

Match the statement and name

### 'Matching names' sections can be difficult

- The answers are <u>not in order</u> in the passage
- One name may be used for <u>more than one answer</u> (if it matches more than one of the statements)
- Some of the <u>names may not be needed</u>

### Techniques

1. Underline 'keywords' in each statement
2. Scan the passage to find all of the names
   - Highlight each name clearly (e.g. circle them)
3. Choose the name with the shortest description
   - Read the sentences around that name
   - Underline the main ideas relating to that name
4. Compare with all of the question statements
   - Go through the question statements to see if any of them match what you read

## Lesson 8 - 'Short answer' questions
